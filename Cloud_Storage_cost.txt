### Azure Blob Storage and Google Cloud Storage (GCP) with respect to:

1. Upload cost (ingress)

2. Storage cost (monthly)

3. Lifetime / recurring charges

4. Other possible charges






1. Uploading a File (1 GB)
    ✅ Ingress (upload) is FREE on both Azure and GCP

        Both platforms do not charge for data upload (ingress) into their storage services.

        So uploading your 1 GB file doesn't incur a charge just for the upload.


2. Monthly Storage Cost

    Once uploaded, you will be charged for storing that 1 GB file every month. Storage is not free for life — it's billed monthly.

    Here are the estimated storage prices (as of late 2024) for Standard Tier in the US or similar regions (rounded for clarity):

        | Cloud | Storage Class    | Monthly Price (per GB) | Total Monthly for 1 GB |
        | ----- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
        | Azure | Hot Blob Storage | ~$0.0184 per GB        | ~$0.0184               |
        | GCP   | Standard Storage | ~$0.020 per GB         | ~$0.020                |


3. Is It Free After Upload? (Lifetime?)

- No. Once a file is uploaded to Azure Blob or GCP Storage:

    - You are charged monthly based on:

        - File size (e.g., 1 GB)
        - Storage class (Standard, Cool, Archive, etc.)
        - Region (pricing can vary per location)
        - There is no free lifetime storage.
        - Even if you never access or change the file, it still costs monthly.


4. Additional Costs to Be Aware Of

| Cost Type             | Azure                                             | GCP                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Egress (download)** | Charged (e.g., ~$0.09 per GB after free tier)     | Charged (e.g., ~$0.12 per GB after free tier) |
| **Operations (API)**  | May be charged for frequent access in lower tiers | Same — especially in Nearline/Coldline        |
| **Early deletion**    | Archive/Cool tiers have minimum storage durations | Same for Coldline/Archive classes             |
